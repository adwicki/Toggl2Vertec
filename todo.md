# Ideas

## Commands

* `t2v sickday` - records a sickday in Vertec
* `t2v holiday [from-date] [to-date]` - records holidays in Vertec

## Others

* check .net5 vs .net6 binary on target with only .net6
* different strategies for lunch time "estimation"
* confirmation before Vertec update if there are warnings
* configurable confirmation before Vertec update always/never
* A `--no-color` switch to suppress ANSI color output and possibly "pipe detection" to automatically do that when not outputting to a terminal
* A configuration option to _disable_ loading of the configuration in the user's home directory
* Show total work time and possibly colored _delta_ to required work time in summary output
* Implement summary output as a processor
